        The origins of Tame Impala can be found in the Perth music scene. Musician Kevin Parker played in a number of bands, one being the Dee Dee Dums, a rock duo that consisted of Parker (guitar) and Luke Epstein (drums). Tame Impala emerged in 2007 as a home-recording project created by Parker, and he posted a number of tracks on <a href="myspace.html">Myspace</a>. This generated interest from a number of labels and eventually, he signed a worldwide deal with the independent Modular Recordings in July 2008.
